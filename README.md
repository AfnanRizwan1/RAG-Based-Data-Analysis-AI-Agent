✨ Data Analysis RAG Agent
A powerful Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) AI agent designed to perform intelligent data analysis by combining the strengths of large language models and vector-based search. This project leverages semantic embeddings, vector storage (Pinecone), and natural language prompts to analyze, summarize, and answer questions about structured and unstructured data.

🔍 Features
📊 Data Analysis: Ask natural language questions about your datasets

🔎 RAG Pipeline: Combines retrieval and LLM-based generation

🧠 Semantic Search: Uses multilingual embedding models for context-aware responses

🛢️ Vector Store Integration: Connected to Pinecone for fast and scalable document retrieval

🌐 Multilingual Support: Works across multiple languages using E5 or Gecko models

⚙️ Tech Stack
🧠 LLM: Google Gemini / OpenAI GPT (configurable)

📦 Embeddings: textembedding-gecko-multilingual@latest or multilingual-e5-large

📚 Vector DB: Pinecone

🔁 Workflow Automation: n8n

📝 Optional: Google Sheets integration for dynamic data sources
